## Introduction

The Tea Protocol Governance Documentation is a valuable resource for understanding how the Tea Protocol community collaboratively makes decisions and directs the future development of the protocol. Governance within the Tea Protocol empowers users to actively participate in proposing, discussing, and voting on changes and improvements.

## Key Concepts

- **TEA Tokens:** The native governance token of the Tea Protocol, enabling holders to participate in the governance process.

- **Staking:** Users can stake TEA tokens to earn stTEA, which provides voting power and influence in governance decisions.

- **Proposals:** Formal suggestions for changes or additions to the Tea Protocol. Proposals can cover various aspects, such as protocol upgrades, feature additions, or parameter adjustments.

## Participating in Governance

To actively participate in Tea Protocol governance, follow these steps:

1. **Acquire TEA Tokens:** Obtain TEA tokens through supported exchanges or by participating in the Tea Protocol ecosystem.

2. **Stake TEA for stTEA:** Stake TEA tokens to earn stTEA, which grants voting power in governance.

3. **Engage in Discussions:** Join community forums, Discord channels, or other communication platforms to stay informed and discuss governance proposals.

4. **Vote on Proposals:** Use your stTEA to vote on governance proposals that align with your preferences and the best interests of the Tea Protocol.
